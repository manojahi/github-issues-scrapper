# github-issues-scrapper
Python flask application to fetch Issues statistics for a github repository.

Github issue tracker by Manoj Ahirwar

Solution:
TO fetch github repository issues, i used Python beautifulSoup to scrap the webpage data and process accordingly.
To fetch the values, first i needed to go through github webpage code to understand where is the data present in the code.
and using CSS classes/IDs as beautifulSoup selector, issues statistics are fetched.
